    <h3>Automated Indian Sign Language Recognition System Using LSTM Models</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our research primarily centers on the efficient and effective detection of sign language. Conventionally, sign detection relies on either hardware sensors or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models. While hardware sensors can be efficient, they often pose cost challenges. On the other hand, CNN models offer a balance of accuracy and costeffectiveness, prompting us to opt for a software-based approach over hardware. We have leveraged numerical keypoints and landmarks to recognize various signs, employing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) framework. This RNN incorporates various Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. Our research aims to elucidate the outcomes achieved by different LSTM variants and assess the overall performance and efficiency of this software-driven approach.</li>
